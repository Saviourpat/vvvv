      <p>3MTT gave me you. <br><br>
        Your bright smile, infectious laugh, and unparalleled intelligence captivated me. <br><br>

        As we worked together on projects, I discovered your kindness, empathy, and generosity. 
        Your passion for coding and problem-solving inspired me.
        
        But it's not just your technical skills that impress me; it's your beautiful heart, your compassion, and your unwavering optimism.
        <br><br>
        Esther, our software development class was just the beginning. 
        You've become my partner in every sense. Here's to many more adventures, laughter, 
        and late-night coding sessions. Happy birthday, my love
